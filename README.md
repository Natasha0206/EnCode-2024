PROBLEM STATEMENT
Next-Level NPS - Revolutionizing Feedback Mechanisms

In today's competitive landscape, customer feedback is 
invaluable. The ability to extract actionable insights is 
paramount for product and service improvement. One of 
the most important ways to measure customer satisfaction 
is through the Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey.

The challenge is to develop an AI-powered snap-in for NPS 
Survey collection, storage and analytics mechanisms. The 
solution should leverage the capabilities of the DevRev 
platform, utilizing its APIs.
Next-Level NPS - Revolutionizing Feedback Mechanisms


KEY OBJECTIVES
Build a mechanism to create a customized NPS Survey 
and send it out at pre decided intervals to a pre decided 
audience and collect the survey results. This 
mechanism should ideally take results from as many 
channels as possible (eg:- emails, Slack, support -
portals, chat widgets like PLuG, etc).

=> Develop a system to derive meaningful analytics and 
insights from NPS survey results. These insights 
should aid in enhancing the product or service based 
on customer feedback.

=> Implement an intelligent mechanism to identify and 
filter out spam surveys. Protect the authenticity of 
responses by ensuring only genuine feedback 
contributes to the analysis.

=> Build a robust system to protect customer 
information. Guarantee the confidentiality and privacy 
of users while collecting valuable feedback. 

=> Create a feedback loop that dynamically adjusts 
based on NPS survey results. Develop a mechanism 
for real-time adjustments and improvements in the 
product or service, fostering a continuous 
improvement cycle.
